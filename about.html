                <p class="paragraph-text">With a background in Finance, Marketing and Management studies, I have started on a new journey learning web development.  I’m passionate about web technologies with a focus on front-end engineering and UX/UI design. <br>   <br>COVID-19 has impacted many people across the globe, including me. When lockdown was announced back in 2020, I had no clue what was going to happen with my job.  Our industry  has been widely affected and I was asking myself what the best next step is. As I browsed the internet I read an article which sectors are most stable and not threatened by this turbulent time. IT sector was a clear choice.<br><br>I was motivated to start something new. I did a little research on the knowledge I need to learn for the successful transit of my career. Out of curiosity I searched on Czechitas website, which is an organization focused on IT talents looking for a new job in the IT field. Shortly after, I took a html, css course and I started coding as a way to gain a new skill during the long days of lockdown. <br><br>I was motivated to start something new.

Shortly after, I took a html, css course and I started coding as a way to gain a new skill during the long days of lockdown.<br><br> After I completed a master's degree in marketing, finance and management I worked some time as a credit analyst and AR receivables specialist. By mid 2017 at the age of 26, I decided to leave my job. I felt I needed a change, a break from open space office work. I got a chance to travel around Europe as a flight attendant. I did also various certification courses in the field of wellness. After that I applied this knowledge while working in Germany and Austria, where I am up to now. So far, I am still working as a Massage Therapist and at the same time I am preparing for a career change into the IT field. After the experience with corona lockdown, I am ready to switch career to IT industry.</p>
